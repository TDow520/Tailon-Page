        <h2>Hello</h2>
        <p>My name is Tailon Dow.</p> 
        <p>I have recently graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from the Troy University. I am learning to code to get into a field that I enjoy doing and one that I will be able to use to help develop/design programs for companies and still enjoy my family and life. I love to dance, play video games, watch anime, travel, and occansionally workout. Having served in the military for 13 years, I have come to understand a disciplined yet personable leadership style.  I have held many leadership positions from trainer to shift-lead and even produciton super for a deployment.  I ahve learned how to manage personnel and help develop others to reach the acheivements that they are striving for.

            <h3 >Writing</h3>
            <p>I began writing when I was in the 10th grade. I have not yet published any books, but I have shelves of filled notebooks in my office. The reason I enjpoy writing is how freeing it is when telling a story.  The ideas come to mind and the characters seem to just take a life of their own in my head. I enjoy watching the scenes playout as if im watching a movie.  The main reason why i havent published anything, is due to me being so descriptive and having to go back and edit the writing to use more context clues to help the reader assume what the environment or person looks like.</p>

            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p>It was a journey for me to finally decide to start this path.  I went from Mechanical Engineering as my major to working on Aircrafts for the Air Force.  From there I came to realize my love for computers and the services that they provide.  I wanted to try making my own video game and went to the Art Institute in Tucson, Arizona.  This fell through but i still pressed on and changed my degree to Computer Science. I am now learning more coding languages from C++, Java, HTML, and Python. </p>
